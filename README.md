# Bioinformatics Algorithms

## Overview
This repository contains my personal implementations of core algorithms from Bioinformatics Algorithms: An Active Learning Approach by Phillip Compeau & Pavel Pevzner, exploring computational techniques widely used in bioinformatics. Each module focuses on understanding, implementing, and testing algorithms from scratch, without relying on high-level libraries. It serves both as a learning record and a reference for key algorithmic concepts in computational biology.
